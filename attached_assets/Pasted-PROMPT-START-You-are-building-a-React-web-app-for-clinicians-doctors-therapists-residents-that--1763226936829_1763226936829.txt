PROMPT START

You are building a React web app for clinicians (doctors, therapists, residents) that assists with note-taking and learning. The app will:
	1.	Capture patient encounter summaries via voice or text
	2.	Convert audio → text using ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text (handled by another teammate)
	3.	Convert transcript → SOAP note draft using Azure OpenAI (API call placeholder in MVP)
	4.	Require the clinician to enter their own diagnosis + plan before revealing the AI note (Recall Checkpoint)
	5.	Show a Side-by-Side Compare
	6.	Generate flashcards for spaced repetition review
	7.	Store everything locally only (LocalStorage/IndexedDB) — no HIPAA compliance required for MVP.

This app is intended only for mock/demo cases with no PHI.

🧩 Architecture Constraints

🔹 ElevenLabs STT integration is handled separately — in this codebase, call a placeholder function:

async function transcribeWithElevenLabs(audioBlob: Blob): Promise<string>;

🔹 SOAP drafting uses Azure OpenAI — also placeholder:

async function generateSOAPwithAzure(transcript: string): Promise<string>;

You should include these function signatures and simulate a mocked response for UI testing.

🧑‍⚕️ User Profile

Primary users:
	•	Healthcare providers (MD, DO, PA, NP, RN, PT/OT, Psych, etc.)
	•	Residents & medical students

They value speed, clarity, and cognitive simplicity.

🧠 Data Models

type CaseNote = {
  id: string;
  transcript: string;
  aiDraft: string;
  clinicianDiagnosis: string;
  clinicianPlan: string;
  createdAt: number;
};

type Flashcard = {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  nextReview: number;
  interval: number;
};

🧪 Placeholder Logic

Simulate output for testing:

// Example mock return:
return "SOAP Note:\nS: Patient reports...\nO: Vitals...\nA: Likely...\nP: Start..."

🖥 Tech Stack Requirements

Component	Technology
Framework	React (Next.js or Vite — choose one)
Styling	TailwindCSS
State	Zustand or Jotai
Local DB	IndexedDB (Dexie) or LocalStorage
Audio recording	MediaRecorder API


⸻

🎨 UI Tone (very important)

Clean, calm medical aesthetic — inspired by:

Notion × Calm × Mayo Clinic

Design rules:
	•	Soft neutral background
	•	Medical blue/green accents
	•	Rounded cards, subtle depth
	•	Large, readable typography
	•	Minimal cognitive load

⸻

✔ Deliverables

Generate a complete working UI with:
	•	All pages + navigation wired
	•	Local data persistence
	•	Placeholder functions for ElevenLabs & Azure OpenAI
	•	Responsive design, mobile and desktop ready
	•	Fake sample case data included
